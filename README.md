# learn-fs-dev

This repository was initially created to track my progress in learning web development and participate in the #100DaysOfCode challenge. However, after completing 26 days of the challenge, I transitioned to hosting my projects on Vercel by creating separate repositories for each project.

## Why I Stopped Updating This Repository

As my projects grew and I gained more confidence in my web development skills, I found it more convenient to host each project on Vercel using separate repositories. This allowed me to focus on building and deploying projects quickly without the overhead of maintaining multiple projects within a single repository.

## Where to Find My Latest Projects

You can find my latest web development projects hosted on Vercel. Here are the links to some of my recent projects:

- [Project 1 Repository](link-to-project-1-repo)
- [Project 2 Repository](link-to-project-2-repo)
- [Project 3 Repository](link-to-project-3-repo)
